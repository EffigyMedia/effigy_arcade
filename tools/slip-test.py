"""SLIP TEST - a wet road carries you further than you asked, by a knowable amount.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/slip-test.py

RLG-048 and RLG-132. Owner, 2026-08-31: "when you turn the vehicle, it moves further than
you intend based off of the Delta that you've moved so if you steer discreetly, there will
be less slip, but if you make larger movements than the slip is larger too. The function of
the slip is the wetness/iciness." And: "with practice, you can understeer to get the amount
of steering you need given the environmental state of the ground. Instead of it being a
pure hindrance, it's something you can learn to work with."

THE SECOND QUOTE IS THE ONE THIS FILE EXISTS FOR. A slip that is proportional and does not
fade can be AIMED AT: on a given surface, asking for four fifths of a lane puts you in the
next lane exactly. That is a skill rather than an affliction, and it is a property a check
can state precisely - understeer by the predicted amount and land on the mark.

WHAT WOULD BREAK IT, and each of these was built and discarded on the way here:

    a slip that FADES      aiming short lands you short, because the road gives the extra
                           and then takes it back. There is nothing to learn.
    a slip that FIGHTS     a restoring force absorbs it. The first rewrite injected a
                           lateral velocity of 0.73 lane units a second and produced two
                           per cent of a lane, because the steering recovered a fifth of
                           the error every frame.
    a slip with NOISE      the amount cannot be predicted, so it cannot be aimed at.

WHY IT CANNOT USE THE DRIVE-TEST AUTOPILOT. That autopilot saws at the wheel, and under a
delta-driven model a sawing driver generates the maximum slip there is. This project has
already been told once that Raceway's tyres died in twenty seconds when the autopilot was
the cause. `API.steerOver` moves the wheel to a mark over a stated time.

BRAKING IS DELIBERATELY NOT LIKE THIS. Owner: "it also directly affects braking, but that
should be modelled more simply such that your braking grip is just reduced based on the
wetness/iciness." So braking stays a plain multiplier, and is checked as one.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO. It cannot say whether the result is FUN, or whether the amount of slip
is the right amount. Both are the owner's on a device.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.

# lands in exactly the reading this check takes. The dry control caught it, which is what a
# control is for.
#

# The first version asked for a full lane. On snow the slip adds a quarter of that, which put
# the aim past the edge of the road - and hitting the barrier ZEROES the slip, because a wall
# does not care how slippery the road is. So the car was shoved to the edge, lost its offset,
# and came back to the mark: the reading was 0.9894 for a movement that should have overshot,
# and it was the engine behaving correctly.
#
# 0.70 IS THE WORKING WIDTH. The largest movement here plus the largest slip the board can
# produce still lands inside the road, so what is measured is the model rather than the wall.

    offset does not decay, so a car that has been steered on snow is still carrying that
    offset when the road turns to rain - and a reading taken without allowing for it
    attributes the old surface's slip to the new one. That is exactly what happened here:
    rain measured 0.1525 where the model predicts 0.060, and the difference was a residue
    left by the snow measurement before it.

    So the residue is READ rather than cleared. Clearing it would need a debug hook that
