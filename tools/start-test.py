START TEST - the car is HELD on the line, not merely covered by a number.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/start-test.py

RLG-088. Owner, 2026-08-30: hitting DRIVE should give a three, two, one, GO countdown, with some
flare.

THE FLARE IS NOT WHAT THIS CHECKS, and it cannot be. Whether a number lands with a punch is the
owner's eye on the device; what a harness can say is whether the countdown is TRUE. A countdown
drawn over a car that is already accelerating is a lie the first frame gives away, so this asks the
three questions that make it real:

  1. the car does not move while the count is up;
  2. the run clock does not start either, so the count is not eating the player's time;
  3. and it does release - the car moves afterwards, or the game has simply stopped.

AND IT ASKS WHETHER THE COUNT IS SKIPPABLE ONLY AFTER THE FIRST RUN, because a start that can be
hurried the very first time is a start most players never see, and one that can never be hurried is
a toll on the player who is enjoying it most.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
