BRAKE AND GRIP TEST - what the fleet actually does when it stops and when it turns.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/brake-test.py

RLG-055, which is blocked on exactly this. `stat-test.py` measures straight-line acceleration and top
speed and nothing else; the owner ruled brake and grip into the fleet table, and RLG-042's lesson is
why the measurement has to come first - there, the top-speed column turned out TRUE while three
comments around it were false, and nobody could have predicted which way that would fall. Lowering a
number without knowing whether it was honest produces a change nobody can interpret afterwards.

MEASURE ONLY. This file proposes no numbers and changes nothing. It reports what the cars do.

WHY IT IS NOT INSIDE `stat-test.py`, WHICH IS WHERE RLG-055 ASKED FOR IT. That harness boots the whole
fleet and drives each car flat out; braking and cornering need a different procedure - a fixed entry
speed, a held brake, and for the cornering experiment NO STEERING INPUT AT ALL. Grafting a second
driving procedure into a harness built for one risks the acceleration numbers that are already
trusted. The fleet picture is assembled from both, and this file says so rather than quietly
diverging.

AND THE CORNERING EXPERIMENT HAS NO DRIVER IN IT, which is the point. RLG-055's own warning is that
grip must not be measured with the drive-test autopilot, because it saws at the wheel and lateral load
is what wears tyres - this project has already once been told that Raceway's tyres died in twenty
seconds when the autopilot was the cause. So the wheel is not touched. `grip` acts through `cornerG`,
which decides how hard a bend pushes the car WIDE; the car is put on a bend at a fixed speed with the
steering untouched, and the measurement is how fast it is pushed out. Nothing a driver does can
influence it, because there is no driver.

WHAT `grip` DOES AND DOES NOT DO, established by reading before measuring. It is consulted in exactly
two places: `brakeOf`, which scales the braking rate, and `cornerG`, which scales how hard a bend
pushes you wide. It does NOT affect how fast the car answers the wheel - that rate is the same for
every body and is moved only by the weather. So a "grippy" car in this engine stops harder and holds
its line, and does not place itself more sharply.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.

# ---- IT RUNS ON THE HIGHWAY, AND THE ROAD IS SWEPT EVERY FRAME --------------
# THE CORNERING EXPERIMENT WAS MEASURING COLLISIONS. Interstate has civilian
# traffic on it, and a car that gets HIT is shoved sideways and slowed at the
# same time - `hurt` pushes `playerX` and then sets `targetX = playerX`, which
# is the exact number this file reads as a cornering push. So a shunt was
# recorded as an enormous push, on a different body every run. That is why the
# CREST and the APEX appeared to defy their own grip, and why the STALLION read
# 0.113 in one run and 0.261 in another on an unchanged build. The speed column
# gave it away the moment it was printed: four bodies went 119 -> 47mph inside
# two and a half seconds, which is not coasting.
#
# MOTORSPORT WAS TRIED AND IS WORSE, which is worth recording so nobody tries it
# again. It is `circuitOnly` and therefore has no traffic at all - but it is a
# CIRCUIT, and it regenerates its own track geometry, so `bendRoad`'s imposed
# constant curvature is wiped and every body meets a different corner. That is
# RLG-062's fault exactly, and it read a spread of 0.056 to 0.989 with 25
# inverted pairs. Its BRAKING numbers came out identical to the highway's, so
# the two roads agree about everything except the thing this needs.
#
# So: the highway, with one constant bend imposed, and the road swept clean
# EVERY FRAME of the window from inside the probe. Clearing once is not enough -
# Interstate spawns more inside two and a half seconds, every time.

   corrects, and the crossing time is the ceiling on lateral speed and nothing else. RLG-055's

   is a measurement of the driver. */

       Two earlier versions of this got the shape of the question wrong and are worth
       recording so nobody writes them again.

       TIMING A SHORT CROSSING measured a blend of two different things. The car is only
       RATE-LIMITED while the ask is far away: `want2` is `(targetX - playerX) * snap * dt`
       clamped to `rate * dt`, so the clamp stops binding once the gap falls under
       `rate / snap` - about a third of the road - and the end of any crossing is decided by
       the convergence rather than by the ceiling.

       TAKING THE PEAK PER-FRAME SPEED was worse and read 12 to 62 lanes a second against a
       ceiling of 4.2. This probe's rAF and the game's rAF are different callbacks, and the
       game steps a FIXED timestep out of an accumulator - so a frame may advance the world
       twice or not at all, and dividing the movement by WALL-CLOCK time between two probe
       samples measures the phase between two loops rather than the car.

       So it records (t, x) and returns them. The rate is read in Python from a long stretch
       that is entirely inside the rate-limited region, with the crossing times interpolated
       between samples - which takes the frame quantisation out. Nothing steers: the ask is
       set once and held. */

         The browser ran this probe at about eleven frames a second, and `frameLoop` caps its
         own `dt` at 0.05 - so at an 90ms frame the world advances 50ms and SIM TIME RUNS
         SLOWER THAN WALL TIME. By a different amount for each body, because a heavier car
         renders slower. Measured against the wall, the ROADSTER read 60 per cent of its
         ceiling and the COMET 96, and that difference was the frame rate rather than the car.
