"""CANYON TEST - the horizon is one mass, and it closes on itself.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/canyon-test.py

RLG-104. Owner, 2026-08-31: of the four gaps offered, canyon and tunnel are the two to
build. THE TUNNEL AND THIS ARE OPPOSITE PROBLEMS - a tunnel has no distance in it, and a
canyon's distance IS a wall.

WHAT IS BEING TESTED IS THE CAPABILITY, NOT THE PLACE. Two places asked the skyline
generator for the same missing thing: this canyon wall and the jungle canopy of RLG-113. So
the checks below are about what a CONTINUOUS form must be, and the canyon is the first place
to state one. (RLG-113 counts the bridge towers as a third request. It is wrong about that,
and RLG-112 says so in as many words: a suspension tower stands ON the road and passes OVER
the camera, which is gantry work rather than a horizon.)

    IT HAS NO GAPS. Every other form walks the horizon placing a free-standing shape and
    then a space. A wall has no space in it, and no column of the sprite may reach the
    ground.

    IT DOES NOT JUMP. Zero gaps is not enough on its own: a row of rectangles packed edge
    to edge also has no gaps, and it is a comb rather than a ridge. The crest of a
    continuous form moves by a bounded step from one column to the next, because it is a
    walk rather than a set of independent rolls.

    AND IT CLOSES ON ITSELF. The skyline sprite TILES across the frame. A crest that ends
    where it likes puts a cliff at the seam and then repeats it across the whole horizon,
    so the last column has to meet the first.

THE CONTROLS ARE THE FALSIFICATION, AND THE THREE RULES ONLY WORK TOGETHER. Every other
place on the board is measured by the same three, and the first version of this harness
asserted the wrong one on its own: a peak line overlaps its own neighbours, so MOUNTAIN
and TUNDRA have no gaps AND a small step, and they are still rows of objects. What only a
closed walk can pass is the SEAM, because nothing else plans the two ends of the tile
together - MOUNTAIN misses it by 60 pixels. So each control breaks at least one rule and
the canyon passes all three, which is what makes this a measurement rather than a
restatement. If the canyon ever falls through to the tower default - which is exactly what
happened to farmland, and is why the form became a stated property - it goes red.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO. It cannot say whether the wall LOOKS like sandstone, whether the strip
of sky between the masses reads as a canyon at speed, or whether a road at 0.90 of bend
between walls is drivable on a phone. `tools/biome-shot.py` takes the picture; the owner
judges it.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
