SKYLINE TEST - the city is the place's, not the hour's.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/skyline-test.py
    .venv/Scripts/python tools/skyline-test.py --headed --shots

RLG-094. The owner reported the skyline jittering and popping, in both the forward view and the
rear-view. It was not a parallax fault. The plan - where every building, peak and tree stands, how
wide and how tall, and which of a tower's windows exist - was built from `Math.random()` inside
`buildSkyline`, and RLG-080 makes that function run whenever the hour BUCKET moves: one fortieth of
a 240-second day, so EVERY SIX SECONDS. The whole horizon was replaced by a different horizon ten
times a minute, in both views at the same instant, because both draw from one cache.

WHAT THIS ASSERTS, AND THE ORDER MATTERS. The silhouette must not change while the car is in one
place. The colour must change all day, because that is what RLG-080 was built for and it is still
wanted. A check that only asserted the first would pass on a skyline frozen at midnight, which is a
different fault and a worse one.

AND IT HAS TO CROSS A BUCKET BOUNDARY OR IT PROVES NOTHING. The fault does not exist inside a
bucket - the broken engine returns a cached sprite there and is stable. So the bucket is read
alongside every sample and the run asserts it moved. That assertion is the whole difference between
this file and one that passes on both builds.

THE SILHOUETTE IS READ AS A PROFILE, not as a pixel count. Two different cities can cover the same
area; `API.skylineProfile` returns the topmost opaque row in each of the sprite's 1024 columns,
which is the outline a player actually sees against the sky.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
