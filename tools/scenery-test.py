SCENERY TEST - a tree approaches the way a thing at that distance has to.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/scenery-test.py

RLG-073. Owner, 2026-08-30: scenery moves away far faster than it approaches - reported about the
forward view, and visible in the mirror as well.

THIS ANSWERS THE GEOMETRY HALF, AND ONLY THAT HALF. Whether a roadside is pleasant to drive past is
the owner's eye; whether an object obeys perspective is arithmetic, and the two are worth separating
before anything is tuned. Perspective gives one law that cannot be argued with:

    apparent width x distance = a constant

so the harness follows ONE object down the road and multiplies. If the product drifts, the scenery
is not being drawn where it is. If it holds, the size is exact and any remaining complaint is about
the FADE or the draw distance rather than about the geometry.

IT FLATTENS THE ROAD FIRST, and that is not a convenience. On the shipped road an object near the
horizon moves mostly because the terrain under it does: the first run of this measurement read a
50-pixel jump that was a hill, not a defect. Hills and bends are removed so the only thing left in
the number is the approach.

AND IT DRIVES PAST THE COUNT-IN. The first version waited 1.4 seconds of a 3 second hold, so the car
was stationary for most of the measurement and the object barely moved - a number the harness had
caused itself, which is the fault this project has been caught by twice before.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
