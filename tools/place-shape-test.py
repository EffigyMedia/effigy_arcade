"""PLACE SHAPE TEST - a place's own bend is in force from its first unit.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/place-shape-test.py

RLG-150, found while measuring RLG-145 item 5. The owner reported that the bridge and the
tunnel both turn too hard, and those two hold the lowest `bend` values on the board. The
numbers were not the ones in force.

WHAT WAS WRONG. `pushCurve` scales a segment by the place it will be in, AT GENERATION - which
is right, because a bend that changed magnitude as you approached it would be the road moving
under you. But the road is generated to `pos + GEN_AHEAD` while a place used to be chosen at
`biomeEdge = here + DRAW`, which is 30,000 ahead. So roughly the first 70,000 units of every
place were made under the PREVIOUS place's factor and nothing went back for them.

WHAT THIS ASKS. Not "is the plan set", which would be a check agreeing with the code it
checks - it drives a passage and measures how bent the road actually is, in eighths, against
ordinary road driven the same way.

IT MUST LET THE TIMER PLACE THE PASSAGE. `startBiomeChange` and `setBiomePair` both place at
the horizon, because a harness cannot drive 70,000 units before it can begin - so they cancel
the plan and DO NOT reproduce the corrected order. Using either here would measure the old
behaviour and report it as a pass. The countdown is driven to zero instead, which runs the real
path, and the roll is repeated until it plans a passage.

WHY IT CANNOT SAMPLE FROM A STANDSTILL. `curvatureAt` reads the segment list, which is trimmed
behind the camera and generated only so far ahead, so anything outside that window answers 0
and a straight cannot be told from a road that does not exist. Two earlier attempts at this
measurement were wrong for exactly that reason. This drives, and samples at a fixed short
look-ahead that is always inside the window.

MEASURED BEFORE THE FIX, so the threshold sits between two known populations. A bridge wants
0.23 as bent as farmland throughout and read 1.29, 1.39, 0.28, 0.27, 0.11, 0.30, 0.09, 0.24 by
eighths; a tunnel wants 0.29 and read 2.24, 0.72, 0.82, 0.55, 0.43, 0.15, 0.35, 0.36. The
entries were six to eight times too bent.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO. One drive is one roll of the generator, and a passage may honestly contain
no corner at all - so this asserts a CEILING and never a floor. It cannot say the road feels
right; the owner judges that on the device.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
