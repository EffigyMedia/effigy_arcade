"""VERIFY - two owner claims, checked rather than taken on trust.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/verify-097-100.py

Owner, 2026-08-31: "ruling 100 is probably unnecessary now because adding earning +10 seconds
to each pick up solved that issue. Also, RLG-097 has been fixed. Let's move both of these to
the end and just do a quick analysis to verify these facts."

TWO CLAIMS, TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF EVIDENCE, and the difference matters.

RLG-097, THE POP ON GO, IS A DEVICE REPORT AND THE OWNER IS THE ONLY WITNESS THAT COUNTS.
This project has RLG-041's lesson written down: five real mechanisms were found and fixed
for that defect and none was the one the owner was seeing. So what this measures is NOT
"is the pop gone" - it cannot see that - but the narrower thing a harness can settle:
whether anything the picture is drawn through still STEPS across the count-in boundary. If
something does, the owner's report is at risk. If nothing does, the fix is consistent with
what they saw.

RLG-100, THE CHECKPOINT BUDGET, IS ARITHMETIC AND A HARNESS CAN SETTLE IT. The claim is
that the crate award closed the margin. That is measurable: drive at full throttle and
watch the clock.

Exit code 0 if both claims survive, 1 otherwise.
