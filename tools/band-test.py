"""Measure the rubber band in Interstate. It changes nothing.

RLG-029 asks one question: does the rubber band actually work? A rival that falls a long way
behind is supposed to get a tow, and a rival that gets a long way ahead is supposed to get a
governor. The complaint is that neither appears to happen.

THIS HARNESS MEASURES. IT DOES NOT TUNE. A change made on a guess cannot afterwards be told
apart from one made on a fact, so the numbers come first and the fragment records them before
anything in road.js moves.

HOW THE MEASUREMENT AVOIDS BEING VACUOUS
----------------------------------------
Reading `r.spd` while the band is switched on tells you what the rivals are doing. It does NOT
tell you that the band is what makes them do it - the same speeds could come from the skill
spread, from traffic, or from the `AI_TOP` ceiling. Four guards in this project's fix list
already passed with the bug present, so an uncontrolled reading is not evidence.

So the run happens TWICE, against the same scenario:

  band on    road.js exactly as it ships
  band off   road.js with `const band = clamp(...)` rewritten to `const band = 0`, IN THE
             SERVER, in memory. No game file is touched on disk.

If the band does what its comment claims, the two arms must differ. If they do not differ, the
band is inert and the measurement says so with a control behind it. The rewrite is asserted to
hit exactly one line; a control arm that silently patched nothing would be the vacuous proof
this file exists to avoid.

THE EXPERIMENT
--------------
Driving a race and waiting for a gap to open naturally does not reach the interesting part: the
band saturates at 1.27 miles of separation, and a 30-second run does not produce that. So the
initial condition is SET rather than waited for, and then HELD: three rivals are tagged once the
race has settled, and each is pinned to its lead on every tick so the band value it sees is a
constant this harness chose rather than a number that drifts differently in the two arms.

  behind   held two miles back   - the tow should be at full saturation
  ahead    held two miles up     - the governor should be at full saturation
  near     held a tenth back     - the reference, and the only one still inside traffic

Then their speed is sampled for the rest of the run. Speed, not the gap to the player: the
player's car is quicker than `AI_TOP` by twenty miles an hour, so the gap to a rival behind
grows whatever the band does, and reading the gap would report that as the band failing. What
the band controls is `want`, and what `want` controls is speed.

# --- find the interpreter that has Playwright --------------------------------
# Playwright lives in the project's own `.venv`, because it cannot be installed into the
# environment's uv-managed Python (PEP 668 refuses). That is fine when a person runs this from the
# project folder. It is NOT fine under `step.py`, which is how a measurement becomes evidence:
# `step.py` runs its command with the ENVIRONMENT root as cwd, and on Windows `CreateProcess`
# resolves a relative EXECUTABLE against the calling process's directory rather than against `cwd`.
# So `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` cannot be reached by any relative path from there, and an absolute
# one would put a drive letter into the evidence fragment, which `Path_Policy.md` forbids.
#
# The way out is for the harness to find its own interpreter. Run it with whatever Python is on
# PATH; if that Python has no Playwright, it hands over to the venv and gets out of the way.
#
# harness.py documents this same CreateProcess trap for `node`. It is the second time it has bitten.

     its lead on every tick. The band value it sees is then a constant that this harness chose,
     and its speed is the only thing left free to move.

     Pinning has a second effect worth stating, because it is doing real work: a rival held two
     miles from the player is in clean air, since traffic spawns around the player. That takes
     the `want = min(want, blocking car)` clamp out of the reading. The rival held at -0.10 is
     NOT in clean air, and it is kept for exactly that contrast.
