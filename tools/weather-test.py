WEATHER PAINT TEST - the weather is on the surfaces, not over the frame.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/weather-test.py
    .venv/Scripts/python tools/weather-test.py --headed

RLG-057. Snow cover and rain darkening used to be screen-wide rectangles drawn after the road
and after the player, so the car got as snowed on as the ground it was standing on, and a hill a
quarter of a mile away got as wet as the tarmac under the wheels. The owner rejected the snow
half of that on sight. Both are painted per segment now, mixed into each surface's own colour.

WHAT MAKES THIS A TEST AND NOT A SCREENSHOT. Reading pixels off a live frame proves nothing in
this engine - the road scrolls, the sky turns, and the tarmac strobes light and dark by segment.
This project has been burnt by that already: `lamp-test.py` read 100% and then 35% on
consecutive runs of one unchanged build. So the world is stopped first. The car is parked at a
fixed `z` at zero speed with the sky pinned, and every reading comes from that frozen frame with
nothing changed between samples except the weather.

AND THE CHECK IS SHOWN TO FAIL. The assertion that carries this file is that the PLAYER'S CAR
does not change colour when the weather does - which is precisely what the rejected build got
wrong. A check nobody has watched fail is not evidence, so the last section puts the old
full-screen wash back through `CFG.afterDraw`, touching no game file, and asserts that the same
check goes red. If it does not, this harness is measuring nothing.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
