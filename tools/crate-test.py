CRATE TEST - a pickup pays what this car can actually use, and says what it paid.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/crate-test.py

RLG-107. Owner, 2026-08-31: "for cars with no NOS, picking up the pickup says '+0 NOS', but that
should be omitted if they don't have NOS."

THE AWARD WAS WRONG BEFORE THE TEXT WAS, and that is why this checks the car and not just the label.
`nos` was raised in four places without one of them asking whether the car has a bottle - the repair
crate, threading a roadblock gap, putting a cruiser out, and the trickle that refills it over a run.
So a LORRY carried a charge it could never spend, and the crate announced it. Hiding the label would
have left the charge there, so what is asserted is that the CAR did not gain it.

AND THE THIRD CASE, WHICH IS THE OWNER'S DECISION OF 2026-08-31. A car with no bottle at full health
drove over a crate and got NOTHING - the exact problem the bottle top-up was added to solve, left
unsolved for half the fleet. It is paid in SECONDS now, which is the currency Interstate is played
in and the one a checkpoint already pays out.

IT PARKS ITS OWN CRATE. Crates spawn out of sight and sit on the SHOULDER at 0.86 to 1.02 of the
road, so reaching one by driving means measuring the spawner and the verge instead of the pickup.
`API.parkCrate` puts one on the REAL crates array with the fields the spawner gives it, in front of
the car, so the real pickup test runs on it - the same reason `parkTraffic` exists.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
