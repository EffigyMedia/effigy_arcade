BIOME TEST - a biome change is a place you drive into, not a colour that flips.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/biome-test.py
    .venv/Scripts/python tools/biome-test.py --headed

RLG-022. The owner asked for the new biome's colour to be taken by the road slices "from the
furthest point forward" so it travels toward the camera, with a blend band between the two, and for
the band under the horizon to match the foreground and sit slightly darker. RLG-059 adds that each
biome must be strict about its ground colour.

WHY THIS NEEDS A HARNESS AND NOT A SCREENSHOT. The transition takes as long as it takes to drive the
length of the drawn road. One frame cannot show travel, and two frames of a moving game differ for a
dozen reasons that have nothing to do with the biome. So this reads the sweep as numbers over time -
where the boundary is, and how much of the new place each end of the draw is showing - and asserts
the SHAPE of the change rather than any single value.

WHAT IT WOULD CATCH. A flip - the old behaviour - shows the same mix at the car and at the horizon
at every instant. A sweep shows the horizon ahead of the car for the whole transition, and the gap
closing as the player drives at it. The last section puts the flip back and checks that this
distinction actually fails.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
