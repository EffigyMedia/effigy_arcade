"""RLG-053: is a lit lamp the UNLIT BULB DRAWN AGAIN, or something drawn near it?

The owner's ruling is a technique: a lit lamp is never a rectangle with its own coordinates, it is
the bulb the painter already drew, drawn once more in a lit colour. The engine did the opposite, and
the comment above the old `tailLights` admitted it - "These MUST match what paintCar draws... copied
here rather than guessed." Two descriptions of one object. There were in fact three, and one of them
was unreachable.

A count cannot check a technique and neither can a screenshot. What can:

  1. the sprite DECLARES lamps at all - read from the baked canvas, not from a name in road.js
  2. the indicator is WIRED - `signal()` lights it on a car nothing in the game ever signals with,
     which is the ruling that every vehicle's lamps function and only the driver differs
  3. THE LIGHT LANDS ON THE BULB - the pixels that change when the lamp comes on sit inside the
     region the sprite's own unlit bulb occupies, mapped onto the car as drawn

Point 3 is the one that would catch a reskin moving the art and leaving the glow behind, which is
the whole reason the ruling exists.

THE CONTROL, AND IT IS NOT OPTIONAL
-----------------------------------
The world does not hold still: the sky turns, the tail glow follows the daylight, and the car
breathes. Measured here, that is ~800 changed pixels on the car between two frames with the lamp
OFF, against ~120 from the lamp itself. A plain before-and-after diff is mostly churn and reports a
centroid in the middle of the car. So two frames are taken with the lamp off first, and only pixels
that change WITH the lamp and NOT in the control are attributed to it.

WHICH VEHICLE THIS COVERS
-------------------------
The MATADOR body, and only that one. CREST and STALLION still paint their tails straight into the
sprite with no declaration and still light them from a hand-placed pair of circles. The ruling says
one vehicle end to end first, and the record has to say which - this harness is that record, and it
SKIPS rather than passes when the chosen body has not been converted.
