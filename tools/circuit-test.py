"""A CIRCUIT IS NOT A HIGHWAY - and it must stay that way when you stop.

`CFG.circuitOnly` switches off civilian traffic, police, roadblocks and crates,
because a closed track with a lorry on it is not a race. Four of the five
spawners are grouped together behind that gate where it is obvious. The fifth -
the one that drops a car in BEHIND you once you have been slower than the flow
for two seconds - sits up with the speed logic and was outside it, so slowing
down on the circuit conjured civilian traffic out of nothing.

That was reported from play, not caught by a gate, and no existing harness could
have seen it: the drive test holds the throttle down, and this only happens when
you stop.

So this stops. Both games, twelve seconds at a standstill, and then counts the
civilian cars. The circuit must be empty; the highway must not be, because
traffic arriving behind a stopped player is what makes stopping feel exposed.
