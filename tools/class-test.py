"""THE EVENTS ARE FOR THE CARS BUILT TO ENTER THEM - RLG-115.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/class-test.py

Owner, 2026-08-31: "if you have a production or utility vehicle selected, the only mode
available is test drive." Owner, 2026-09-05, on the three questions that blocked it: the
race modes GREY OUT WITH THE REASON GIVEN rather than disappearing; production and utility
vehicles are NOT OFFERED AT ALL in Motorsport; and a save is never allowed to hold a car
and a mode that disagree.

WHAT THIS ASKS, AND WHY IT ASKS IT THAT WAY.

The rule is not "the game refuses to start a race in a van" - RLG-115 names that as the
WRONG build. It is "the menu does not offer what the car cannot do". So every check here
reads the GARAGE, not the start of a run: what the MODE control says, whether it is
disabled, and what the note under it reads.

AND IT DRIVES THE REAL CONTROLS. A harness that called `raceLegal()` and agreed with it
would prove only that the function agrees with itself. This clicks the arrows the thumb
clicks until it reaches a production car, then reads what the player would see.

THE THREE THINGS THAT WOULD MAKE THIS VACUOUS, each guarded:

  1. Reaching no production car at all. If the arrows never land on one - because the
     class is locked on a fresh save - every "the modes are shut" check would pass by
     never being tested. So the debug switch that opens the traffic classes is turned on
     first, and the walk ASSERTS it found one.

  2. Motorsport's list being empty for the wrong reason. "No production car found" is the
     PASS condition there and the FAIL condition in Interstate, so the same silence means
     opposite things in the two games. Both are asserted, and Interstate's is what stops a
     broken walk from reading as a green circuit.

  3. The mode never having been a race in the first place. A control that says TEST DRIVE
     because nothing ever set it otherwise proves nothing. So the walk sets a TOURNAMENT
     on a race-legal car FIRST, confirms it took, and only then goes looking for the van.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
