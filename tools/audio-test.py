"""HARDPOINT AUDIO - does the sound actually follow the ship?

A sound test cannot listen. What it CAN do is read the Web Audio graph: every
held layer is a GainNode and an OscillatorNode with live values on them, so the
question "does the engine get louder when you open the throttle" has a number
behind it.

This exists because the whole point of the audio pass is that the layers are
CONTINUOUS and STATE-DRIVEN. A one-shot either fires or it does not, and a
missing one is obvious the first time you play. A held layer that has quietly
stopped tracking the throttle sounds like a game with an engine drone, and
nobody notices for a month.

What it asserts, in order:
  * the four held layers exist once the run has begun
  * engine level RISES with the throttle
  * engine pitch RISES with speed
  * burn is silent below 100% and audible above it
  * ENGINES DARK takes the engine to silence and leaves the air behind, which
    is the mechanic the game is built on
  * the alarm appears with heat and is silent without it
