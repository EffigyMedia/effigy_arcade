LAUNCH TEST - the grid starts from rest, and the player launches from neutral.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/launch-test.py

RLG-118 and RLG-110, owner-decided 2026-08-31. Two halves of one start line:

  RLG-118  the grid was given a FLYING start. Every rival was built at about 91 per cent of its
           own top speed and the count-in freezes the world by returning early from step(), so the
           field was never held at zero - it was simply not stepped. Eleven cars already at racing
           speed were released against a player sitting at nothing.

  RLG-110  the player is held in NEUTRAL and revving is what buys the launch. The engine had a
           full free-revving neutral branch already and it was gated on the manual gearbox, so an
           automatic sat at idle however hard the throttle was held.

WHAT A HARNESS CAN AND CANNOT SAY. It can say the grid is at zero, that the box is in neutral, that
the needle moves, and that the three outcomes of the window agree with where the needle actually
was. It cannot say whether the window is HOLDABLE with a thumb, or whether the amber band is
legible on a phone. Those are the owner's, on the device.

THE WINDOW IS NOT AIMED AT BY THIS TEST. Landing the needle on a target from a harness is a race
against the engine's own rev decay and would make the check a timing test rather than a behaviour
one. Instead three starts are driven - never touching the throttle, holding it flat, and walking the needle
toward the band - and what is asserted is the RELATION: where the needle was, against what the game said
happened. That cannot pass by accident and it cannot flake on a frame.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
