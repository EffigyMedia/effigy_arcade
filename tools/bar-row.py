"""WHERE A LIGHT BAR ACTUALLY SITS ON A SPRITE, measured rather than guessed.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/bar-row.py

`barY` is the fraction down the sprite where the bar's lenses are, and the glow heads that
`drawPlayer` throws are placed from it. The note beside it in `road.js` says the two existing
values were SAMPLED from the built sprites - CRUISER rows 18-22 of 164, mid 0.122;
SUPERCRUISER rows 49-53 of 168, mid 0.304 - and that "any future force car declares its own".
A guessed value puts the glow off the bar, which is the exact defect that note records fixing.

HOW IT MEASURES, and the first draft did it wrong. Sniffing the built sprite for strong blue
and red pixels found nothing, because the sprite table is built lazily and because a colour
test has to know what colour to look for - which fails the moment a bar is not blue-and-red,
and an ambulance's is not. So it asks the LAMP DECLARATION instead: RLG-053 made every lamp a
named function that draws itself into any context, so `bar.rl` and `bar.rr` can be rendered
into a blank canvas and their rows read off. No colour knowledge, and it works for a scheme
nobody has invented yet.

IT PRINTS THE TWO KNOWN CARS AS A CONTROL. If CRUISER does not come back at about 0.122 and
SUPERCRUISER at about 0.304, the measurement is wrong and the new number it reports must not
be trusted either. The control is what makes this more than a number generator - it caught the
lazy-build fault above rather than reporting "no bar found" for a car that plainly has one.

Exit code 0 if the controls agree, 1 otherwise.
