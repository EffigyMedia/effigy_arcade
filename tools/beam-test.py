BEAM TEST - the headlights lay light on the road, and only when the road is dark.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/beam-test.py
    .venv/Scripts/python tools/beam-test.py --shots

RLG-060. Owner, 2026-08-30: the beams do not look right, and they seem to be on all the time.

IT PHOTOGRAPHS THE SAME ROAD TWICE, once with the beam and once without, and subtracts. That is the
only way to ask what the BEAM did rather than what the scene looks like. Comparing two times of day
instead would change the sky, the ground tone and every lamp in the picture along with the one thing
being measured, which is the mistake `lamp-test.py` was rewritten to stop making.

AND IT MEASURES ITS OWN NOISE, ROW BY ROW. The scene does not hold still: traffic drives and the sky
turns, and at midday a bright sky moves ten times the brightness a dark one does. One number for the
whole picture is useless in both directions - it failed a correct build at night, and at midday it
grew so large that a beam drawing in broad daylight would have passed underneath it. So every run
takes TWO beam-off frames first, keeps the difference between them per row, and then asks of each row
whether the beam added more light than that row moves on its own.

The four questions:

  1. does the light reach the tarmac beside the car - the fault the owner saw, where the throw began
     above the car's own roofline and the road at the bumper stayed dark;
  2. does it stay on the ground - a beam has no business above the horizon;
  3. does it die out on the road rather than stopping at a line;
  4. is it off in daylight, and off because of the CLOCK rather than by luck.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
