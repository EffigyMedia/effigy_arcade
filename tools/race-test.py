RACE TEST - a race has checkpoints, whatever the timed toggle says.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/race-test.py

RLG-089. Owner, 2026-08-30: turn TIMED off under TEST DRIVE, and a RACE started afterwards has no
checkpoints in it - and turning TIMED back on before switching to RACE does not fix it.

IT REPRODUCES THE SEQUENCE, NOT THE SYMPTOM. Starting a race with the toggle off would have found
the first half of this and missed the second. The owner found it by turning the toggle off under one
mode, back on, and then changing mode, which is what says the state was being decided once and kept
rather than read at the start of the run. So the harness walks the same path.

AND IT COUNTS BOARDS ON THE ROAD, not a setting. `clockRuns()` was already the correct predicate and
was already wrapping the code that places them; the defect was a second, wrong question asked inside
it. A check written against the predicate would therefore have passed on the broken build, which is
the same trap `lamp-test` and `beam-test` were each rewritten to get out of.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
