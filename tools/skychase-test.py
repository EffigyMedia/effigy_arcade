SKY CHASE TEST - the skyline answers a corner in seconds, not in frames.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/skychase-test.py
    .venv/Scripts/python tools/skychase-test.py --headed

RLG-096. The skyline's parallax is chased toward the bend a long way ahead, and the chase was a fixed
fraction PER FRAME: a time constant of about 22 frames, which is 0.37 seconds at 60fps and 0.18 at
120. How fast the city answered a corner was decided by the refresh rate of the device it happened to
be running on.

WORSE THAN A WRONG NUMBER, IT WAS AN UNSTEADY ONE. The frame rate is not constant within one run -
`fps-test` measures FOREST between 45 and 60 on one unchanged build - so the chase sped up and slowed
down as the scenery thickened. That is a horizon that surges and lags for no reason visible on
screen, and it is the kind of fault that produces a jitter report nobody can reproduce, because
reproducing it needs the reporter's frame rate.

HOW THIS MEASURES IT WITHOUT A SECOND DEVICE. The car is parked, so `bendPx(pos + 30000)` is
constant and the chase has a fixed target. `API.setSkySmooth` pushes the value away from that
target; after a fixed WALL-CLOCK time the residual says how fast it came back. Then the same
measurement runs again with the CPU throttled, which cuts the frame rate without touching the clock.

A chase in seconds returns the same residual at both frame rates. A chase in frames does not: at
half the rate it gets half as far, so its residual is many times larger. The assertion is that the
two residuals AGREE, and the check prints the frame rate it actually measured at, because a run
where the throttle did not bite would compare a rate with itself and pass on any build.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
