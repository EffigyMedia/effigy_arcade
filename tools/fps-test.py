FPS TEST - how many frames a biome costs, WITH ITS SPREAD.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/fps-test.py

NEVER QUOTE A SINGLE RUN OF THIS. Measured on one unchanged build, a forest came
back 54.5, 60.2 and 57.0 fps in three consecutive runs. Two rounds of scenery
tuning were done against single readings inside that spread before the spread was
measured - which is to say, against noise. `occlusion-test.py` carries the same
warning about its cull count for the same reason.

So this takes several samples per biome and prints the LOWEST and the highest. A
change is only real if the ranges do not overlap.

It asserts nothing. It is an instrument, not a gate.
