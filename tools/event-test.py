"""EVENT TEST - a place with a stated length and an authored shape.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/event-test.py

RLG-112. Owner, 2026-08-31: "The bridge would start with a vertical ramp up, be flat the
entire way and then ramp down at the end transitioning into the next biome."

NOTHING IN THIS ENGINE COULD SAY THAT. Every place lasts six and a half to twelve miles at
random and its terrain is a stream of rolled segments scaled by the place's own relief -
right for a forest, which is a tendency of the land, and wrong for anything somebody built.
RLG-112 says to build the mechanism ONCE, for the bridge and the tunnel together, rather
than scripting one road.

    A LENGTH THE PLACE STATES. A tunnel was six and a half to twelve miles of bore - two and
    a half to four and a half minutes underground against a run clock that starts at sixty
    seconds, so a bore could outlast the run it appeared in.

    AND A SHAPE THE PLACE STATES, WHICH IS A SEPARATE FIELD. A tunnel takes the length and
    NOT the shape: the owner has already ruled on a bore's form and capped both of its axes
    at 0.10. Two fields rather than one is the test of whether this is a mechanism or a
    special case wearing a table entry.

THE ONE THAT MATTERS IS THE LAST, AND IT IS EASY TO GET A FALSE GREEN ON. The rolled
segments are still generated inside an event and the integration overrules them, so
`roadRoughness` - which reads the segment list - stays exactly as it was and would be green
on a build where the profile does nothing at all. This reads the INTEGRATED cache instead,
which is the road the picture draws and the car drives on.

AND A FLAT DECK IS A CLAIM ABOUT THE SLOPE, NOT THE GRADE. The integration is `dy += grade;
y += dy`, so a stated grade of zero holds whatever slope the road arrived with - ask for a
flat bridge that way and you get a straight ramp continuing to the horizon. The profile
replaces the slope, and this checks the slope.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO. It cannot say whether the ramp FEELS like driving onto a bridge, whether
the rise is big enough to read at speed, or whether the crest at each end is comfortable.
`tools/biome-shot.py` takes the picture; the owner judges it.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
