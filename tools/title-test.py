TITLE TEST - the car on the title card wears the engine's own lamps.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/title-test.py

RLG-077. The owner: the title menu shows the wrong tail lights, and it may be that the title is not
using the right renderer. It WAS using the right renderer and then painting over it - two red
rectangles at hand-written coordinates and a halo at two more, on a sprite that already knew where
its lamps were.

HOW THIS PROVES THE DIFFERENCE, and it is not a picture. Strip the sprite's lamp DECLARATION at
runtime and look at the title again. If the lamps come from the declaration they go out; if the
title is painting its own rectangles, nothing changes at all - which is exactly what the old code
would have done. So the check is a comparison between two states of the same running title rather
than a comparison with an expected image.

AND IT COUNTS RED PIXELS IN A BAND RATHER THAN DIFFING FRAMES. The title car sways, the sun's bands
creep and the stars twinkle, so a frame-to-frame diff is mostly churn - the fault RLG-053 already
paid for twice. A count of strongly-red pixels across the car's own horizontal band does not care
where in its sway the car happens to be.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
