"""RLG-041 - vehicles disappear and reappear. This is the MEASUREMENT, and it changes nothing.

The owner reported it from play on a real device. Nothing here has ever reproduced it, and the
fragment is explicit that the first unit is an instrument rather than a fix, for a reason the
project has already paid for once: "occasional" and "disappear and reappear" fit at least four
mechanisms present in this engine, and a plausible-sounding rendering cause has produced a wrong
plan in this codebase before.

THE QUESTION THE RULING ASKS, IN ONE LINE
-----------------------------------------
Is the vehicle still in `traffic` or `racers` at the moment it is not drawn?

  still in the array   a DRAW fault. The object exists, the painter declined to paint it.
  gone from the array  a SPAWN or CULL fault. Nothing was asked to paint it, correctly.

Those are different bugs with different fixes, and a harness that cannot separate them is worth
nothing here. So every event below is stamped with both.

WHAT IT READS
-------------
`road.js` carries a ledger behind `API.watchDraw()`. Every vehicle offered to the painter records
the reason it did or did not appear, and the reasons are the painter's own exits rather than this
file's idea of them:

  drawn / clipped   painted; `clipped` is a car across a crest, which is deliberate (RLG-021)
  behind            nearer than 430 units - behind the camera
  noproj            the projection refused the point
  tiny / huge       too small to see, or so close it fills the screen. NEITHER counts a stat
                    today, so both are invisible to `spriteStats`
  offscreen         off the top or the bottom of the frame
  crest             entirely under a hill silhouette
  unbucketed        outside the drawn road, so the painter was never offered it
  unemitted         bucketed, but the road never painted that slice. This IS the occlusion
                    mechanism, not a fault by itself
  nosprite          no painter entry for that body

A POP, DEFINED WITHOUT REFERENCE TO A CAUSE
-------------------------------------------
A vehicle that was painted, then was not painted, then was painted again, while never leaving the
array. That is what "disappears and reappears" means from the seat, and it is measured as such: the
reason is recorded but no reason is assumed. A car that leaves the array and comes back is a
different event and is counted separately - it cannot be the same car, but it can look like one.

WHAT THIS CANNOT TELL YOU
-------------------------
It runs at desktop frame rates in a headless browser at 480x900. The owner's report is from a phone.
A pop that only happens under a frame-time spike, or at a device pixel ratio this never sees, will
not appear here - and a clean run is therefore NOT evidence that the reported fault does not exist.
Say so in the record rather than closing the fragment on it.
