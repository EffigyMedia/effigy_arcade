VERB TEST - muting a bus mutes its reverb, and does not mute anyone else's.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/verb-test.py

RLG-078. The owner: "if I was to mute the music, the reverb bus still plays so we want to make sure
muting the music also mutes that bus." There was one convolver and its return went straight to
master, so a voice was connected twice and only the dry copy rode the mute.

WHY THIS LISTENS RATHER THAN READS. A check that reads a gain value off the Web Audio graph is not
reading the graph - RLG-065 cost three attempts on exactly that, and a GainNode on a closed context
reports a healthy value quite happily. A ROUTING fault is worse still: it changes no gain anywhere,
so there is no value to read that could be wrong. The only thing that answers "did the tail come out
of the speaker" is the signal, so this hangs an analyser off master and measures it.

AND THE SECOND HALF IS WHY THE OBVIOUS FIX IS WRONG. Muting the single shared return would have
silenced the report and taken the sound effects' reverb with it, because one return carried both. So
this asserts BOTH directions: music muted leaves nothing of a music tail, and leaves an effects tail
alone.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
