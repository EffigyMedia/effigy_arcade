"""INTERSTATE OCCLUSION - are cars hidden, or are they missing?

Crest occlusion in this engine has been wrong twice, and both times it was
invisible to every gate: the road still drove, the console stayed clean, and the
only symptom was that things stopped being on it. One of those attempts culled
EVERY distant sprite and the note left in the source records the result - "23
cars in range, 0 drawn".

A screenshot cannot settle it either, because an empty road and a road whose
cars are all behind a hill look the same in one frame.

So this drives for a while and reads `API.spriteStats()`, which counts what the
sprite pass did rather than what it was asked to do:

  drawn    fully visible
  clipped  straddling a crest - drawn, cut off at the silhouette
  culled   entirely under a crest

What it asserts:
  * sprites are being drawn at all, in quantity          (the 0-drawn failure)
  * culling is not swallowing most of them               (the over-cull failure)
  * over a run with hills, at least some get CLIPPED     (partial occlusion
    actually happening, rather than the test being disabled again)
