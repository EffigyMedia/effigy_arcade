MIRROR RAIN TEST - the weather falls in the rear-view as well.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/mirror-rain-test.py
    .venv/Scripts/python tools/mirror-rain-test.py --headed --shots

RLG-092. Owner, 2026-08-31: rain and snow should be shown in the rear view - the precipitation
itself, not the drops on the glass, which belong to the windscreen. RLG-079 had already ruled that
the mirror shows the world state it is in and asks the SAME functions the windscreen asks; falling
weather was the part of that world state which never got carried across.

WHY THIS DOES NOT MEASURE THE OBVIOUS THING. "The mirror looks different when it rains" was true
BEFORE this was built, and it would pass on the old engine: the mirror already darkens its tarmac
and lifts its ground toward white, because those come from the shared surface code RLG-079 wired
up. A check written that way would report a feature that is not there.

SO THE COMPARISON IS PARTICLES AGAINST NO PARTICLES, in one and the same wet scene. `mirrorRain`
takes a count and zero means off, so the harness can remove the feature through the public API
without touching the engine, and the only difference between the two frames is the thing that was
asked for. The world is frozen for both - biome pinned, car parked, sky pinned - so nothing else
can move between them.

AND THE CHECK IS SHOWN TO FAIL. The last section runs the same assertion with the count at zero and
requires it to go red. A check nobody has watched fail is not evidence, and four guards in this
project passed with the bug present before they were fixed.

WHAT IT CANNOT SAY. Whether twenty particles in a pane 59 pixels tall reads as weather or as static
is a judgement on a device. `--shots` writes the glass enlarged so that judgement can be made from a
picture instead of from this number.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
