HEAT TEST - the wanted level is earned and it cools; it is not a clock.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/heat-test.py

RLG-030. Owner, 2026-08-30: "I don't think time should increase it at all. It should purely be from
speed traps and taking out cops. I think if you outrun a cop for long enough, your heat would
probably go down so long as you don't pass another speed trap over the speed limit." And: "Super
cruisers should not be dispatched unless you are heat three and above and have gone 170 miles an
hour past a speed trap."

Heat used to rise by one every twenty seconds whatever you did and never fall, so it reached five
inside eighty seconds of any run - a timer wearing a wanted level's costume, and about to become
five stars on the screen.

WHAT IT CANNOT CHECK, stated so nobody reads a green run as more than it is: tripping a real speed
trap and wrecking a real cruiser are not staged here. Both raise heat by one line each, and both
were read rather than driven. What is driven is the part the owner's ruling turns on - that time
does nothing, that clear air cools, and that a super cruiser needs two different things.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
