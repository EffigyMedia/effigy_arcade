"""BORE ORDER TEST - a car inside a tunnel is in front of the tunnel wall.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/bore-order-test.py

RLG-145 item 4. Owner, 2026-09-01, with a capture: traffic inside the bore had the wall and
the floor painted straight across it.

THE SUBJECT IS A DRAW ORDER, AND A DRAW ORDER IS SETTLED BY THE PIXELS. `draw()` calls
`drawRoad`, which paints the road AND emits the sprites, and then calls `drawBore`. So the
question this asks is not "is the order right", which would be a check agreeing with the code
it is checking, but "is the car ON THE SCREEN when there is a tunnel around it".

HOW IT ASKS. The road is frozen, the place is pinned to TUNNEL at both ends of the blend so no
frame lands mid-crossing, and one car is parked at a stated distance and a stated offset
across the road. The canvas is read twice - once with the car and once without - and the
pixels that differ ARE the car.

AND THE CONTROL IS THAT SAME CAR MOVED BACK TO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. That is the whole
design, and it is the second design: the first compared a car in a tunnel with the same car in
FARMLAND and was useless twice over. Farmland has moving scenery, so two frames of it differ
by hundreds of pixels on their own. And the car it compared stood at the CENTRE of the
carriageway, where the bore never covered it - so the check passed with the defect present,
which was watched happening before this was rewritten.

THE WALLS CONVERGE ON THE VANISHING POINT, so they close over the EDGES of the road long
before they reach the middle. A car half a lane out is behind the wall and the same car in the
middle is not. Comparing the two is comparing an identical sprite at an identical size under
identical light with no scenery anywhere to move by itself, so anything the offset car has
lost, the bore took.

MEASURED BOTH WAYS BEFORE THE THRESHOLD WAS CHOSEN. With the bore painted over the traffic, a
car at the road edge keeps 15 to 75 per cent of itself and its box is visibly cut off at the
bottom. With the bore drawn under it, 82 to 99. The check reads the WORST of twelve
placements, so it sits at 55 with the two populations far to either side.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO. It cannot say the tunnel LOOKS right, and it deliberately asserts nothing
about the far end: a car deep in the bore SHOULD be swallowed by the depth fade, exactly as
the tarmac is, so that decay is printed and not gated. `tools/biome-shot.py` takes the picture.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
