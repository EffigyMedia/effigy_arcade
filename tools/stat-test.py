"""Do the cars do what the table says, and does everything on the road share one physics?

RLG-042, and it changes nothing. The owner ruled that "all cars, even the traffic, play off the same
reality and physics", that racer vehicles mirror the player-capable cars, and that a traffic car has
real stats with its DRIVER as the limitation. Before any of that is built, and before RLG-043 lowers
a single number, this says what is true today.

A code read says there are three models and a fourth for the garage card. A code read is not
evidence - RLG-029 established that at some cost, where the rubber band's tow was believed to be a
weak effect wanting a tune and was in fact arithmetically unreachable. So each claim here is put to
an experiment that could refute it.

THREE EXPERIMENTS
-----------------
1. CARS        Every driveable body, from a standstill, in cleared air: the real 0-60 and the real
               top speed, against `zeroSixty()` - which is what the garage card prints - and against
               `MAX_SPD * vmax`, which is what the table declares.

               The air is cleared rather than avoided: `traffic` and `cops` are emptied every tick
               for the duration. A 0-60 measured while something drives into you is a measurement of
               the collision.

2. GEARBOX     The decisive one, and it settles by EFFECT what a code read can only suggest.
               `aiGearFactor` calls `gearTable()`, which reads `optBody` - the PLAYER's car. If that
               matters, then changing the player's gearbox must change how fast the RIVALS
               accelerate, which is absurd and therefore worth proving rather than asserting.

               A rival is held two miles behind, in clean air, where the rubber band is saturated
               and identical in both arms. Its speed is knocked down to 40% of its target and the
               recovery to 90% is timed. Then the same rival, the same seed, the same grid - with
               the player sitting in a four-speed MUSCLE, and again in a six-speed FORMULA.

               Note what this does NOT test. `aiGearFactor` derives its rev fraction as
               `(rpm - IDLE) / (redline - IDLE)` where `rpm` was built from the same `redline`, so
               the redline cancels exactly and cannot be the signal. GEAR COUNT is the signal: four
               ratios against six.

3. TRAFFIC     What the traffic on the road is actually doing, by type, against what `BODY` says
               that vehicle can do. If traffic never reads `BODY`, these two columns are unrelated
               numbers and lowering one will not move the other.

4. STOP & TURN RLG-055 is blocked on this one. Every body declares a `brake` and a `grip` and
               nothing has ever measured either, so the fleet table cannot be rewritten without
               changing numbers whose honesty is unknown - which is exactly the trap RLG-042 found,
               where the top-speed column was true and three comments around it were false.

               BRAKE is a stopping distance. From 140mph, brake held, in cleared air, to 40mph:
               the distance covered and the time taken. Distance is the figure that matters,
               because a corner arrives at a place rather than at a moment.

               GRIP is measured WITHOUT A DRIVER, and that is the whole design of it. The engine
               pushes the car to the outside of a bend at a rate set by `cornerG()`, which is
               `0.42 / grip`. So the car is pinned at one position on the road - one constant
               curvature - held at one speed, and NOBODY TOUCHES THE WHEEL. The time it takes to
               drift a fixed distance across the road is the grip, and no steering input can
               contaminate it.

               That matters here more than anywhere. The project has already been told once that
               Raceway's tyres died in twenty seconds, when the cause was the drive-test autopilot
               sawing at the wheel: lateral load is what wears a tyre, and a driver in the loop is
               the thing being measured. There is no driver in this loop.

         both come back as "did not reach it". A RATE reports either way: how
         far across the road per second, with the mean curvature it happened in
         and why the window closed, so a short window is still a number.
         --------------------------------------------------------------- */
      /* ---- INTEGRATE THE PUSH, DIVIDE THE DRIFT BY IT --------------------
         A rate in lanes per second is only comparable between two cars if they
         were pushed by the same amount, and they never are: a bend is entered
         at a different point every time and `pushK` lags the road by
         CORNER_LAG, so the first half-second of any corner is a different push
         from the rest of it.

         So the push is integrated as the engine applies it -
         `pushK * v^2 * dt`, exactly the expression in `stepCar` - and the
         drift is divided by it. What comes out is `cornerG` as MEASURED, and
         `cornerG` is 0.42/grip by definition. Multiply the measurement by the
         declared grip and every car should read 0.42. Any car that does not is
         a car whose grip is not doing what it says.

         `targetX` and not `playerX`: the corner moves the target and the car
         follows it a moment later, so measuring the follower measures a lag
         that has nothing to do with grip.
