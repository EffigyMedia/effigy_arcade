"""BRIDGE TEST - the water is on both sides, it reaches the horizon, and it recedes.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/bridge-test.py

RLG-112. Owner, 2026-08-31: a bridge over water, where the water "wouldn't be level with the
bridge - it would be drawn as a complete surface underneath the bridge".

THE FRAGMENT NAMES THE HARD PART AND THEN SAYS NOT TO SOLVE IT YET. Every surface this
engine draws sits on one ground plane, so a second altitude is not something the projection
can express. A second plane is the honest answer; a fill from the horizon down is the cheat.
It says to build the CHEAP one first and let the picture decide, and the reason is in this
project's own record - the far sea was built twice and the version that measured better was
the one that made no estimate at all.

SO THE CHEAT IS THAT THE PLACE'S GROUND IS WATER, and these are the claims that makes:

    IT IS ON BOTH SIDES. A coast has water on ONE side, from a shoreline a fixed distance
    out from the tarmac. A bridge has no shoreline at all - the water reaches both frame
    edges - and every hard part of the coast is therefore absent.

    IT REACHES THE HORIZON. The strip between the skyline and the furthest drawn slice is
    painted by the far field rather than by the road pass. A place whose ground is water and
    whose far field is not shows a band of land above a sea, which is where the coast ran
    out before RLG-093.

    AND IT RECEDES. Water at one flat colour from the bumper to the skyline reads as a
    painted floor. The distance term is the coast's own, measured at its join.

THE COAST IS THE CONTROL AND IT IS RUN ON EVERY CLAIM. A check that passed on both places
would not be measuring a bridge - it would be measuring "is there water on the screen". The
coast must still come back with land on one side, and if the shoreline work is ever broken
by this, that is where it shows.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO. It cannot say whether the crossing reads as a bridge rather than a
causeway - it will not until the towers and the deck are built - or whether the water looks
right in motion. `tools/biome-shot.py` takes the picture; the owner judges it.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.

        # AND THE GLASS. Owner, 2026-09-01: all of it "needs to be properly visible in the
        # mirror". One painter serves both views, so this is a check that the mirror was
        # actually given the call rather than that a second copy agrees with the first.
        #
        # WHAT IT DOES NOT SEPARATE, measured rather than assumed. The glass carries two
        # things - the railing and the towers - and this counts both together: 319 orange
        # pixels with both, 253 with the towers alone, 72 with the railing alone, 0 with
        # neither. So it proves ironwork reaches the mirror and would NOT catch one of the
        # two going missing on its own. Splitting it would need the pane divided by
        # something that separates a rail from a tower's legs, and neither is confined to
        # a part of the glass the other stays out of.
