MIND TEST - the car is capable, the driver decides.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/mind-test.py
    .venv/Scripts/python tools/mind-test.py --headed

RLG-054. Owner, 2026-08-28: every NPC gets a driving personality in three categories - Racer, Speeder
and Civilian. It is one system for rivals and traffic alike, and it is the project's spine applied to
behaviour: RLG-042 gave traffic real stats and made their drivers the limitation, RLG-052 wired every
indicator and left nothing asking them to come on, and this is the same shape a third time.

THE ASSERTION THE RULING ACTUALLY TURNS ON IS THE ONE ABOUT CAPABILITY. "A personality is a set of
DECISIONS. It must not adjust the car's capability." A personality that quietly made a car faster
would reintroduce the exact fault RLG-042's measurement found, under a friendlier name - so the
load-bearing check here is that no driver, of any mind, ever exceeds what their vehicle can do. A
Speeder in a lorry is a speeder in INTENT and drives a lorry.

AND THE MIX IS SAMPLED FROM THE ENGINE'S OWN ROLL, not computed here. Rarity is the specification -
the owner said "very very rare" twice about the supercars and "rarely" about a traffic Racer - and a
rate of one in fifty cannot be measured against the thirty-odd cars the road holds at once. The engine
rolls thousands on request; a check that carried its own copy of the odds would agree with itself
after somebody changed them.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
