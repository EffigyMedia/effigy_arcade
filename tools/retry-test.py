RETRY TEST - a retry starts a new run, not the last one continued.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/retry-test.py

RLG-090. Owner, 2026-08-30: on a time-over, hitting RETRY carries state over into the new run - you
start in a dry biome with snow slipperiness still applied.

TWO PIECES OF STATE DISAGREEING IS WORSE THAN EITHER BEING WRONG. The place is fresh and the grip is
not, so the road looks like one thing and drives like another, and nothing on screen explains why
the car will not hold a line.

IT DIRTIES THE WORLD ON PURPOSE FIRST. A run that happened to be dry would start a clean run and
prove nothing, so the harness puts deep snow and a storm sky on the road itself, checks they are
really there, and only then starts the next run. That is the difference between testing the reset
and watching a run that had nothing to carry.

AND IT ASKS THE ENGINE WHAT A RUN OWNS RATHER THAN LISTING IT HERE. `worldState` reports exactly the
fields `freshWorld` clears, so a field added to the world is covered by this check without the check
being edited - which is the whole point of RLG-090, since three of these have now been found one
after another.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.

# ---- WHAT A CLEAN RUN MEANS, AND IT IS NOT "DRY" -------------------------
# This asserted a dry, clear sky, which was right while `freshWorld` zeroed everything and
# left the first roll to the drive. It is wrong now: a run ROLLS ITS OWN WEATHER at the
# reset, so that the player looks at the weather they are about to drive in rather than
# having it arrive on GO (RLG-090). A fresh run may legitimately start in snow.
#
# So the question is not whether the weather is off. It is whether the weather is the NEW
# run's own: nothing accumulated survives, what is falling is what this run rolled, and
# nothing is left sitting due.
