"""Everything that can be behind you has a face.

The mirror draws the FRONT of a car, because a car behind you is coming at you. Three times a vehicle
has been found with no front sprite at all and fallen back to a coloured block: the racers, which are
keyed by body and paint rather than by traffic type; the police, which were excluded by a test in the
mirror itself; and, before both, every car in the game before the front painters existed.

Each one was found by eye, on a phone, weeks after it shipped. This asks the engine the same question
`drawMirrorFull` asks - what would you draw for this vehicle - for EVERY vehicle at once.

It also checks the sprite is a real picture rather than an empty canvas, because a blank sprite and a
missing one look identical in a mirror and only one of them is caught by a null test.
