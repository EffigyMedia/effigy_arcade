SEA JOIN TEST - the water runs to the horizon as one body.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/seajoin-test.py
    .venv/Scripts/python tools/seajoin-test.py --headed --shots

RLG-093. Owner, 2026-08-31: the ocean drawn into the background - can the angle it is drawn at be
interpolated from the slice segment's ocean, so it runs to the horizon seamlessly and reads as one
body of water.

THE RULING SUPPOSED AN ANGLE AND THE FAULT WAS A COLOUR. That is why this file measures both, and
why only one of them is a gate. The band above the furthest drawn slice is painted inside `drawSky`,
BEFORE `drawHaze()`, so the distance wash falls on it; the road's own sea is painted after and gets
none, and `seaTone` had no distance term at all. So the water changed colour at the join - by up to
45 in summed RGB, a pale blue meeting a dark green-grey - while its SHAPE was continuous the whole
time.

THE ANGLE WAS MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS BELIEVED. Across 13 bands in 40 places, the straight line
creased by at most 2.0 times the edge's own curvature, which is pixel quantisation. The shoreline is
carried on rather than straightened - it is the right construction, and it is asserted structurally -
but it is not what anybody could see, and this file says so rather than claiming a fix.

AND THE TONE IS SWEPT INSIDE SINGLE FRAMES, NEVER ACROSS RUNS. The road is generated per load and the
day is always turning, so two runs differ in the road, the hour and the sea's own colour at once -
RLG-062's lesson, written after a claim was made and withdrawn on exactly that. `API.seaHaze` moves
the value live, so every comparison here is made on one band at one hour with one thing changed.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
