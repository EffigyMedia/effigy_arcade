"""TUNNEL TEST - dark by day, through the one lamp clock, and the mouth is a ramp.

    .venv/Scripts/python tools/tunnel-test.py

RLG-105. Owner, 2026-08-31: canyon and tunnel are the two structural places to build.
"NOTHING ON THE BOARD IS DARK BY DAY, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT."

THREE CLAIMS, AND THE SECOND IS THE ONE WITH A RULING BEHIND IT.

    IT IS DARK AT MIDDAY. Every other place in the game is lit by the hour and the weather
    alone, so a tunnel at noon would have been a bright corridor.

    AND THE DARKNESS COMES THROUGH `lampsOn`, WHICH MUST STAY ONE FUNCTION. Every lamp in
    the game asks it - the headlight beams, the street lighting, and all 178 declared lamps
    across 59 vehicles. A tunnel that lit its cars by a second route would be two answers to
    one question, and the fragment says so explicitly because the jungle's canopy is going
    to ask the same question next. So the check does not merely ask "is it dark": it asks
    whether the darkness arrives through the shared clock.

    AND THE MOUTH IS A RAMP RATHER THAN A CUT. Coming out is a large sudden brightening at
    speed, repeated every time the place ends - the same photosensitivity hazard RLG-060
    gave the lightning a comfort option for. The darkness rides the biome crossing, so this
    checks that it passes through intermediate values instead of stepping.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO. It cannot say whether the bore LOOKS like a tunnel, whether the ceiling
lamps read at speed, or whether the exit is comfortable on a real screen. `tools/biome-shot.py`
takes the picture; the owner judges it.

Exit code 0 if every check passed, 1 otherwise.
