"""Does traffic actually change lane, or does it move a fraction of one?

RLG-040. The owner reported it from a phone: "when traffic merges, they don't go fully to a new
lane. It's like a fraction of a lane." RLG-033 part 1 measured the same fault from the rivals' side
and put a number on it - rivals spent 59-61% of their time off a lane centre - so this harness asks
the same question of the other code path.

WHAT IS MEASURED, and all of it from OUTSIDE the merge logic
------------------------------------------------------------
The engine's own merge state is not read. A car's lateral position over time is, at 20Hz, and every
number below is derived from that alone - so this instrument cannot be fooled by a merge that is
recorded as made and never carried out, which is the exact failure being investigated.

  moves        a completed lateral move: a car that was standing still across the road, moved, and
               came to rest again. Counted per car, so a car that is culled mid-move contributes
               nothing rather than half a move.
  size         how far that move went, in LANE WIDTHS. One lane is the whole point of the ruling.
               The lane width comes from the engine (`API.laneX()`), never from a copy kept here,
               because RLG-024 is going to widen the road and a harness with its own LANE_X would
               keep reporting on the old one without being able to say so.
  landed       the share of completed moves that came to rest within 0.15 lanes of a lane centre.
               A move that ends between two lanes is the fault, whatever its size.
  off-centre   the share of ALL samples more than 0.12 lanes from the nearest lane centre. The same
               definition racer-test uses for rivals, so the two code paths can be read together.

YIELDERS ARE COUNTED SEPARATELY, AND ON PURPOSE
-----------------------------------------------
`keepLaneOpen` deliberately leans a car toward the verge, past the outermost lane, to hold a
corridor open (RLG-037). That is not a merge and it is not meant to end on a lane centre. A car
that has ever yielded is reported on its own line and excluded from the assertions - the only
place this harness looks at engine state, and it looks at it to CLASSIFY, never to judge.

THE VACUITY GUARD
-----------------
"No fractional merges" is also what a road with no merges at all reports. The run fails if it
observes fewer than `--need-moves` completed moves, and it cross-checks its own count against
`API.mergesMade()` - if the engine says it decided on merges and this sampler saw none of them
carried out, the sampler is what is wrong.

Math.random is seeded before any game script runs, so two invocations meet the same grid and the
same traffic. Read the lesson in RLG-033 first: a number from a harness like this one is not
established until two separate invocations agree, because a session fixes its seeded grid at the
start and between-session variance is the larger kind.
