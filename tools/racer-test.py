"""Measure what Interstate's rivals actually do. It changes nothing.

RLG-033 part 1. The fragment asks for racing lines, defending and personality, and the owner ruled
that none of it is built before there are numbers describing the behaviour that exists now. The
reason is RLG-029, one unit ago: the rubber band's tow was believed to be a weak effect that wanted
tuning, and it was not weak - it was arithmetically unreachable, and no amount of tuning would ever
have found that. An impression about AI behaviour is worth exactly as much.

WHAT IS MEASURED
----------------
  passes/min   a rival's z crossing a traffic car's z, counted per rival per minute. This is a
               COMPLETED overtake. Cars are identified by a tag put on them the first time they
               are seen, so a car that de-spawns and a car that was passed are not confused.
  blocked      the share of samples with a SLOWER car within two seconds of travel ahead, in the
               same lane. Stated in seconds of travel rather than in the engine's own 3600 units,
               deliberately: a harness that measures with the engine's constants is testing the
               engine's arithmetic against itself.
  off-centre   the share of samples more than 0.06 lanes from the nearest lane centre. A car
               mid-move is between lanes, so some of this is wanted - but a car that is between
               lanes MOST of the time is not overtaking, it is wandering. That is the number
               RLG-033 part 2 was built to move: it read 59-61% under the old pressure model.
  lateral      mean lateral speed in lanes per second - how much steering is happening.

THE CONTROL ARM
---------------
The same discipline as `band-test.py`, and for the same reason: a number with nothing to compare it
against cannot tell you whether the mechanism you are looking at is the one producing it.

  changes on    road.js exactly as it ships
  changes off   road.js with the rival's choice of a new lane neutralised, rewritten IN THE SERVER,
                in memory, no file touched on disk

With changes off a rival still holds a lane, still slows for what is in front, and still steers to
its lane centre - it simply never picks a different lane. So the difference between the arms is
what CHANGING LANE is worth, and nothing else.

Math.random is seeded before any game script runs, so both arms race the same grid and the same
traffic. Runs are repeated, because one run is weather.
