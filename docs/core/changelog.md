# Changelog

The append-only index of what shipped and when, keyed to version. One short dated entry per feature
commit. Newest on top. **An entry is never edited after the fact.**

Each entry links to the fragment that holds the full record. This project keeps no `tracker.md`, so
a link points at the fragment file itself: `[RLG-001](../fragments/RLG-001.md)`. Both directions
must resolve, and that is verified at every audit.

**The history before this file begins is Tiny Arcade's**, and it came across whole rather than being
squashed. That project's own changelog stops at 0.9.11 and stays in its own repository. The version
here reset to 0.1.0 at the fork: the engine did not get younger, but this product's own work had
barely started, and 0.9.x would have claimed otherwise.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-25
- Added: **Effigy Arcade** — Derelict, Privateer, Highway and Raceway on one floor, forked from Tiny
  Arcade at v0.9.11 ([RLG-001](../fragments/RLG-001.md)).
- Changed: the launcher opens straight onto the rack. The three-shelf picker is gone; the shelf
  mechanism is kept whole behind a single shelf whose id `all` matches every cabinet, so a fifth
  machine or a real second shelf is one entry away ([RLG-001](../fragments/RLG-001.md)).
- Removed: fifteen machines, and the fourteen fonts that belonged only to them — 324KB off the
  offline precache ([RLG-001](../fragments/RLG-001.md)).
- Fixed: the `every .md is accounted for` gate tested a file called `*.md` in a folder with no root
  document, because an unmatched glob stays literal in bash. Latent in the parent, which always had
  six documents at its root ([RLG-001](../fragments/RLG-001.md)).
- Fixed: the archive step assumed `zip` is on PATH, so a build passed every gate and then died on
  its last line. It falls back to PowerShell's `Compress-Archive`
  ([RLG-001](../fragments/RLG-001.md)).
