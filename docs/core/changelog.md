# Changelog

The append-only index of what shipped and when, keyed to version. One short dated entry per feature
commit. Newest on top. **An entry is never edited after the fact.**

Each entry links to the fragment that holds the full record. This project keeps no `tracker.md`, so
a link points at the fragment file itself: `[RLG-001](../fragments/RLG-001.md)`. Both directions
must resolve, and that is verified at every audit.

**The history before this file begins is Tiny Arcade's**, and it came across whole rather than being
squashed. That project's own changelog stops at 0.9.11 and stays in its own repository. The version
here reset to 0.1.0 at the fork: the engine did not get younger, but this product's own work had
barely started, and 0.9.x would have claimed otherwise.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-08-25
- Changed: **Interstate's verge costs speed, not health.** The barrier took 9 health on a repeating
  cooldown, so sliding along a wall was as expensive as hitting a truck. It scrubs speed
  continuously instead ([RLG-016](../fragments/RLG-016.md)).

<a id="v0-7-0"></a>
## [0.7.0] — 2026-08-25
- Added: **Hardpoint's full sound pass.** Four held layers that follow the ship every frame — engine
  (pitch on speed, level on throttle), afterburn, hull air, and separate alarms for heat and hull.
  Every sound before this was a one-shot, so the ship had no engine
  ([RLG-015](../fragments/RLG-015.md)).
- Added: **the engine mechanic is audible.** Engines dark spins the engine down to silence and leaves
  the air louder than it was under power — measured 0.128 to 0.002, air 0.035 to 0.055
  ([RLG-015](../fragments/RLG-015.md)).
- Added: a three-tier bed — bridge, hunted (a heartbeat on the off-beat), and boarding — plus its own
  slower bed on the title ([RLG-015](../fragments/RLG-015.md)).
- Added: nine events that were silent — the hunter arriving, losing him, the hull breach, being
  repelled, dying, the relight, the airlock, and footsteps paced by distance walked
  ([RLG-015](../fragments/RLG-015.md)).
- Added: `tools/audio-test.py`, which reads the Web Audio graph because a sound test cannot listen
  ([RLG-015](../fragments/RLG-015.md)).

<a id="v0-6-0"></a>
## [0.6.0] — 2026-08-25
- Removed: **every controls screen.** These are touch games, and a page listing gestures describes
  what the interface already shows one tap away ([RLG-014](../fragments/RLG-014.md)).
- Changed: Quietus's emergency light is **bolted over the hatch and pulses** instead of swinging
  across the frame. Nothing else in that room moves, so a drifting light read as a floating
  rectangle. It is drawn as a fitting now — housing, lens, wire guard, brackets and a throw on the
  plating ([RLG-014](../fragments/RLG-014.md)).
- Added: `tools/menu-test.py`, which asserts every title has the same set and that OPTIONS returns
  to it ([RLG-014](../fragments/RLG-014.md)).

<a id="v0-5-1"></a>
## [0.5.1] — 2026-08-25
- Fixed: **Quietus drew its title as `IET`.** Its hand-painted blood alphabet was authored for
  DERELICT and had no Q, U or S, and an unknown character draws nothing and reports nothing. The
  three letters are drawn ([RLG-013](../fragments/RLG-013.md)).
- Added: `Arcade.wordmark` reports a missing glyph on the console, once per word, naming the
  characters — and `smoke-test.py` now fails a cabinet on console errors, so a machine that quietly
  fails to draw its own name is a failing gate ([RLG-013](../fragments/RLG-013.md)).

<a id="v0-5-0"></a>
## [0.5.0] — 2026-08-25
- Added: **Hardpoint's title is an animated chase** — two ships, the hunter firing on the runner,
  lit thrusters, three parallax star layers, a sun off frame and a planet turning under it. Drawn
  every frame, nothing downloaded ([RLG-012](../fragments/RLG-012.md)).
- Changed: the veil turns to glass while the title is up, so the scene is visible rather than painted
  and covered ([RLG-012](../fragments/RLG-012.md)).
- Added: `tools/scene-test.py`, which asserts the scene paints, runs on the title, and **stops** when
  another screen takes over ([RLG-012](../fragments/RLG-012.md)).

<a id="v0-4-1"></a>
## [0.4.1] — 2026-08-25
- Changed: the driving wordmark is a **marque lockup** — REDLINE small above, INTERSTATE or
  MOTORSPORT large beneath. Set as one line it read as a single long name and shrank the half that
  actually names the game ([RLG-011](../fragments/RLG-011.md)).
- Changed: **HARDPOINT is cut from hull plate** — brushed steel, panel seams with rivets, scuffs, a
  rim light and a warm engine bounce, clipped to the letters so the material runs across the whole
  word ([RLG-011](../fragments/RLG-011.md)).

<a id="v0-4-0"></a>
## [0.4.0] — 2026-08-25
- Changed: **every machine owns everything it stores.** The shell's options, the audio settings and
  the record of seen intros were shared between all four; they are now scoped per machine under
  `Arcade.scope`, read from a new `<meta name="arcade-id">` ([RLG-010](../fragments/RLG-010.md)).
- Fixed: the shell's options were keyed on a slug of the cabinet's **title**, so the rename orphaned
  them — and that shape was invisible to `Arcade.save.clear`, **so erasing a machine had been
  leaving its settings behind while reporting success** ([RLG-010](../fragments/RLG-010.md)).
- Added: the launcher seeds a cabinet's audio settings once, on first visit, and the cabinet writes
  them down and owns them from then on ([RLG-010](../fragments/RLG-010.md)).
- Added: `tools/isolation-test.py`, and the `saves()` check now covers all six stores
  ([RLG-010](../fragments/RLG-010.md)).

<a id="v0-3-1"></a>
## [0.3.1] — 2026-08-25
- Added: **Hardpoint has a proper title** — a drawn wordmark, the career read back as STANDING,
  CREDITS and BEST RUN, and a first button that says `BEGIN` or `CONTINUE` rather than a `PLAY` that
  opened a station screen ([RLG-009](../fragments/RLG-009.md)).
- Fixed: Hardpoint's QUIT hardcoded `../../index.html#em`, naming a shelf that no longer exists. It
  uses `Arcade.home()` like every other machine ([RLG-009](../fragments/RLG-009.md)).

<a id="v0-3-0"></a>
## [0.3.0] — 2026-08-25
- Added: **every machine can erase its own save from its own options**, behind a two-press confirm.
  The label reads `NO SAVED DATA` when there is nothing to erase
  ([RLG-008](../fragments/RLG-008.md)).
- Fixed: `road.js` hardcoded `HIGHWAY` on its Options and Debug screens — and it serves both driving
  games, so Motorsport had been showing the other game's name above its own options
  ([RLG-008](../fragments/RLG-008.md)).
- Added: `smoke-test.py` now drives the erase path on every machine — arm, confirm, and check the
  store after the reload ([RLG-008](../fragments/RLG-008.md)).

<a id="v0-2-1"></a>
## [0.2.1] — 2026-08-25
- Fixed: **erasing a machine did not erase it.** `Arcade.save.clear` removed the save slot only, so
  options, a machine's own stored keys, and the record of which intros it had shown all survived —
  and the call reported success. The launcher's ERASE left even more behind
  ([RLG-007](../fragments/RLG-007.md)).
- Added: `Arcade.save.has(id)` and `Arcade.save.clearAll()`, and a namespace rule in the shell that
  says what belongs to a machine ([RLG-007](../fragments/RLG-007.md)).
- Added: a `saves` check in `smoke-test.py`, run against the old implementation first to prove it
  is not vacuous ([RLG-007](../fragments/RLG-007.md)).

<a id="v0-2-0"></a>
## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-25
- Changed: **the four machines are renamed**, in one unit — Derelict to **Quietus**, Privateer to
  **Hardpoint**, Highway to **Redline Interstate**, Raceway to **Redline Motorsport**. Ids, file
  paths, the catalogue, the engine's default, the drive harness and the save keys all moved together
  ([RLG-006](../fragments/RLG-006.md)).
- Changed: the cache generation is v26. Every cabinet filename changed, so a worker holding the old
  list would ask the server for four files that no longer exist
  ([RLG-006](../fragments/RLG-006.md)).
- Removed: the `#em` / `#sw` shelf hash from each cabinet's `arcade-home`, which addressed a picker
  that no longer exists ([RLG-006](../fragments/RLG-006.md)).

<a id="v0-1-2"></a>
## [0.1.2] — 2026-08-25
- Added: the icon is built from the **Effigy Media symbol** in the arcade's palette, pixelated, and
  generated by a committed script rather than being a binary nobody can regenerate. All six slats
  come from one thickness and one gap, so an uneven slat is not possible
  ([RLG-003](../fragments/RLG-003.md)).
- Fixed: **the loading counter reported files checked, not files fetched**, so it climbed to 18/18
  on every visit and a returning player saw what looked like a full download each time. Measured
  before the fix: cold 26 requests, warm reload 8 ([RLG-003](../fragments/RLG-003.md)).
- Fixed: `fonts/LICENSES.md` was precached — a document no running game asks for. The generator now
  takes `.woff2` only ([RLG-003](../fragments/RLG-003.md)).
- Changed: the cache generation is v25. `icon.png` is a core file, so without the bump every
  returning visitor would have kept serving the old icon out of cache
  ([RLG-003](../fragments/RLG-003.md)).
- Changed: the manifest `name` is `EFFIGY ARCADE`, so every install surface agrees with the
  `apple-mobile-web-app-title` that iOS pre-fills on Add to Home Screen
  ([RLG-003](../fragments/RLG-003.md)).

<a id="v0-1-1"></a>
## [0.1.1] — 2026-08-25
- Changed: **mobile only.** Touch is the input; keyboard, mouse and gamepad are out of scope. Owner
  ruling, recorded with what it makes redundant and what it does not delete
  ([RLG-002](../fragments/RLG-002.md)).
- Documented: a game leaves this arcade by one of two routes — a binary wrapper around the web
  build, or a conversion to Godot. Under the Godot route this codebase is the playable design
  document rather than the shipping artifact, so web-only plumbing is not worth investing in
  ([RLG-002](../fragments/RLG-002.md)).

<a id="v0-1-0"></a>
## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-25
- Added: **Effigy Arcade** — Derelict, Privateer, Highway and Raceway on one floor, forked from Tiny
  Arcade at v0.9.11 ([RLG-001](../fragments/RLG-001.md)).
- Changed: the launcher opens straight onto the rack. The three-shelf picker is gone; the shelf
  mechanism is kept whole behind a single shelf whose id `all` matches every cabinet, so a fifth
  machine or a real second shelf is one entry away ([RLG-001](../fragments/RLG-001.md)).
- Removed: fifteen machines, and the fourteen fonts that belonged only to them — 324KB off the
  offline precache ([RLG-001](../fragments/RLG-001.md)).
- Fixed: the `every .md is accounted for` gate tested a file called `*.md` in a folder with no root
  document, because an unmatched glob stays literal in bash. Latent in the parent, which always had
  six documents at its root ([RLG-001](../fragments/RLG-001.md)).
- Fixed: the archive step assumed `zip` is on PATH, so a build passed every gate and then died on
  its last line. It falls back to PowerShell's `Compress-Archive`
  ([RLG-001](../fragments/RLG-001.md)).
